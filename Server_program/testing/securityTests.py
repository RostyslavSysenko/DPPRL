"""
frequency comparison - count each duplicate occurence of a bloom filter encoding - assuming we know attribute length
Try a dictionary attack
compare with various datasets such as city populations, zipcode populations, common first name and common last name
find real data and compare your results (see how accurate your guesses were)

You guys know more about this than I do, maybe there is a way to figure out what a single bit might represent to completely decode them? Try a letter frequency attack.
Add to this code rather than replacing it, I know it's not exactly what you need but it's a good place to start.
