class ClusterList:
    """
    Guide on how to use this class:
    - this class is to be used inside the server program on a linkage unit
    - this class needs to be instantiated once only and will contain the linkage for records across all databases
    - when using this class, a user would usually want to instantiate an Indexer object from a class that we provided
    and pass it into ClusterList since doing so would allow would allow for multi stage indexing and hopefully good speed up on the linkage
    - Note: clusterList can be used without Indexer and will work just fine, it will just usually be slower, but linkage might be improved
    in quality.
    - After cluster list is created, the cluster list would need to be populated statically using addClusterStaticly(clusterObj) function.
    Please note that to populate the clusterList, user needs to already have a set of clusters and rows corresponding to those clusters.
    This set of clusters with corresponding rows can be generated using our static linkage module (created by Amanda). Then those generated
    clusters and lists need to be converted into appropriate format and inserted into cluster list one by one using addClusterStaticly(clusterObj). 
    The use case for that function can be found inside the testing file for data structures 
    - then once the clusterList is set up we could insert rows dynamically into it using addRowDynamic(row) which would do the insertion
    - use cases of how cluster list can be used can be found inside the testing folder (tests make extensive use of both clusterList and Indexer classes)
